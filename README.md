# Fiware4Water - AI-based Data Validation and Reconciliation Smart Application

## About

This repository contains the implementation of the smart water application ***AI-based 
Data Validation and Reconciliation*** (AI-DVR), which was developed within Demo Case #3 as part of 
the H2020 EU Project Fiware4Water. The Demo Case #3 was conducted in the Amsterdam West 
WWTP, that is operated and managed by the water utility of Amsterdam - Waternet. 

The AI-DVR application was developed as part of the FIWARE-based architecture that was
integrated to the legacy system of Waternet to demonstrate the benefits and non-intrusive 
capabilities of the open-source smart platform called FIWARE (www.fiware.org).

Further details on the Fiware4Water project can be found in - www.fiware4water.eu

## Disclosure
The goal to share this code is to aid developers in how a FIWARE-based solution could be set up for 
handling sensor data. The code will not run successfully unless additional FIWARE components are 
installed and a (possibly local) server is set up where the docker can be run. 

## Developers

The developers of this application are KWR Water Research Institute (www.kwrwater.nl) in 
collaboration with Waternet (www.waternet.nl)
